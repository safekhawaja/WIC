Collaborated with Anshul Tripathi and Jordan Semprevivo

Seamless is an ongoing project on integrating numerous creative arts through embedded systems and materials science. The first iteration, supported by a grant by The Sachs Program for Arts Innovation, was to combine music and art. 

We used PWM and created analog filters that work with a plugged-in iPhone and speakers to create solid-state level interactions between audio, transducers and smart materials.

# 2: Work Incentive Chair

*Best Final Project, Introduction To Circuits and Systems* — Collaborated with Gaston Arguindegui

IoT Chair connected to a web app (ThingSpeak) using two Arduinos (one Wi-Fi enabled, one not — interconnected via bluetooth). 

**FEATURES:**

1. LED Screen displaying posture adjustments (e.g. "lean back") at four points based on resistance of pressure dependent variable resistors

2. Massage - vibration generators triggered with a switch

3. M&M Dispenser using a counting function for good posture at all points of pressure sensor for 30 mins

# 3: Sensaira
[Design Case](https://www.saifkhawaja.com/sensaira)

Collaborated with Alina Peng and Haojong Lu

Sensaira is an __*anti-pollution watch biosensor*__ that detects and responds to low oxygen levels in urban environments through gold yeast, and it notifies users through visual and audio feedback with a color change and emergency alarm. 

This biosensor has the parts of a wearable “watch,” genetically-modified yeast, a micro-controller and power source for Internet connectivity, integrated Bluetooth features (to connect to Apple Health or another application), and a method of detaching the dial to replace the yeast. The form is a re-imagining of the now redundant watch thanks to phones.

The interaction is displayed through a gradient change of color in the bacteria. An alarm output is integrated into the device to ring if the concentration of toxins in the air is too high. This alarm will also be linked to an app that tracks data, and uses a greater network to send warning notifications to other people, if certain areas are extremely polluted. 

# 4: LiteOwl

*Best Final Project, Product Design I (Instructor Rated)* — Collaborated with Ahmed Lone, Karman Cheema and Keen Thompson

**ASK**

Students have to stay up til the wee hours of the morning, more often than not. Mental health issues are pervasive and people don’t receive enough sleep — when they do, it isn’t restful. We looked to redesign a product centered around their behaviors rather than fixing the behavior.

**INSIGHT**

The common platform for working late is the computer. These and the lights around you mimic daytime, so your body doesn’t start it’s winding down process. Blue light filters (such as f.lux) help block the spectrum of light your body recognizes as daylight, but only on computers.

**SOLUTION**

We redesigned the student lamp. LiteOwl sticks on walls and features voice control (Google Speech API), a long wavelength mode for softer lighting, and even a party mode (alternating colors of LEDs). We know you college students love a party.
